## Guidelines for team collaboration

This file is intended to provide some rules and guidelines on how to work as a group to ensure maximum productivity. Anyone in the group is free to edit this file or make any suggestions.

1. Create a branch for each task.

e.g. If you start working on CNN approach 1, create a `cnn-1` branch  and commit all your work relevant to your task onto that branch. **DO NOT** commit any changes of any other task on this branch. When it is done, create a pull request so that other people in the group can review the code. Once everyone agrees, we can merge the branch onto the master.

If ever one were to notice something worth correcting in (for example) `helper_functions.py` **after** having created a new branch. Return to the master to correct it.

2. Restart the kernel and run all cells before committing.

3. Commit code that works.

4. Comment your code as much as possible before committing it (it shouldn't be up to other people reading your code to comment it). Keep comments as concise as possible and use the imperative tense.

5. Keep commits as small and concise as possible. Commit often.

6. Use the **imperative** tense (not the past tense) and capitalize the first letter for commit messages. See https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ for more on how to write good commit messages.

Follow these rules/guidelines and we should be super productive!
